Check the notes below in order to start development

# Prerequisites

* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
* [npm-run](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run) - `npm install -g npm-run`

## Install ImageMagick

ImageMagick is used with `jekyll-responsive-image` plugin and should be manually installed before
plugin gem could be installed.

### Windows

Download ImageMagic 6 (for needed OS architecture) from [here][image_magick_download]. 
Tested with [this one][image_magick_6_x64] for Win10x64.

Install to some location without spaces, e.g.: `c:\tools\imagemagic`.
During installation check  be sure to check following checkboxes:
* Install development headers and libraries for C and C++
* Install ImageMagicObject OLE Control for VBscript, Visual Basic, and WSH

Then install `rmagic` gem with following command, assuming you've installed image magic into `c\tools\imagemagic`:

```
gem install rmagick -- --with-opt-dir=c:\tools\imagemagic
```

# How to build

Use `npm` scripts in order to build whole website into the `public` directory within repository root folder:

```bash
npm run build
```

# How to run DEV server

Use `npm` scripts in order to provide real-time updates of both Angular app
and Jekyll generated content.

In order to run webpack watcher run:

```
npm run webpack:watch
```

In order to run Jekyll web server run:

```
npm run start
```

## What is used in the background?

Webpack uses Bible in order to transpile ES6 JS cone into ES5-compatible one.

Webpack's watchers are used to provide real-time updates of the resulting transpiled 
code base to Jekyll.

Jekyll generates and serves static content.

Firebase uploads generated by Jekyll content to its hosting.

## How to deploy

1. Configure your Firebase account
2. Login into account using `firebase login`
4. Run `npm run deploy -- --project <YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID>` in order to re-build everything and deploy your app
